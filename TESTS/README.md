# Headless gameplay checks

Build C# first, then run the Godot .NET executable:

```sh
godot --headless --path . TESTS/EnemyIntegrationChecks.tscn
```

Checks instantiate production Main/Level001 and test F2/repeat behavior, portal navigation with swept clearance, 100-ship path budget, First/Closest/range, configured bullet damage/cooldown/death, revision repathing, map-edge permissions, actual placement route rejection, and occupancy removal. Terrain changes are confined to the in-memory test instance and never saved over Level001. Manual physics ticks keep checks deterministic. These are correctness checks, not a performance benchmark.

The same scene also runs SwarmNavigationChecks: default profiles must use both corridors, routes must have radius clearance, repeated profile searches must be deterministic, disable/zero-strength must restore ordinary paths, and optional congestion must prefer an empty corridor and clear without weight leakage. A 500-ship fixture prints headless spawn/path/movement timings and checks budgets/repath safety; it does not assert hardware-independent 60 FPS.
