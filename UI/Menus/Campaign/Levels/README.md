## Level002 moved to Level020; fresh Level002 design map — 2026-10-18

The Five Gates is now `LEVELS/Level020/Level020.tscn`, with `Level020Config.tres`, `Level020Waves.cs` and WaveSetId `level020`. Its terrain, object layout, wave composition and balance are preserved. Its standalone launcher/world variant are `MainLevel020.tscn` / `WORLD/WorldLevel020.tscn`; Campaign labels/launches Level020 and PlayableLevelCatalog registers numeric ID20. Scene/script UID sidecars are retained across renames. Tests and current documentation reference the moved map.

Fresh `LEVELS/Level002/Level002.tscn` is copied from the current LevelTemplate with a new root name and independent `Level002Config.tres` copied from DefaultLevelConfig. Empty terrain layers and template background/Portal/Citadel/checkpoint overlay are retained. The template itself is unchanged. Open this scene in Godot's 2D editor to design it. It has no authored waves or playable launcher yet and is not offered as a finished Campaign mission. Add those when the map is ready. Results cannot skip the missing playable Level002 to reach Level020; Level001's Next is disabled for now. Level020 remains available directly from Campaign and F6 on MainLevel020.

Earlier Level002/Five Gates references in historical notes below refer to the map now called Level020. No old design plan or map content was removed. Verification: see `TESTS/Integration/LevelReorganization.md`.

# Campaign Levels

`LevelSelectionMenu.cs/.tscn` owns the mission-selection screen reached from Campaign → LEVELS. It requires the selected local profile, reuses MenuLayout/UIButtonFactory, and launches the same Level001 / Level020 battlefield scenes through MenuNavigation. Back returns to the Campaign hub; missing profiles redirect to Boot.

This is the existing two-mission chooser moved out of the hub. Both missions remain available. No completion stars, locked missions, campaign slots, Continue/Load or unlock progression are invented. Maps and mission settings remain in LEVELS; profile XP/research persistence remains in SYSTEMS/Progression. Research is accessed through the hub between deployments.
